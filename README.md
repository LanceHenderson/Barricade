This is where I am posting alternate versions of my Barricade App.

It was for Industrial Radiographers to calculate safe barricade ditances when using isotope sources and was relaed first on iPhone and later on Android.

I am trying to move away from the app stores and palce more stuff on my own websites to make developement easier and not have to deal with 
the app store buerocracy for these free utilities.

The firt upload here is a version written in MS Excel.
